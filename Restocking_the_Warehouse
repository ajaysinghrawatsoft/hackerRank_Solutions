A purchasing manager must buy a specific number of units of an item to replenish the warehouse. The primary supplier has a list of containers, each with a number of units. The manager must buy contiguous containers, starting at container 0 and continuing until at least the desired number have been purchased. If there are not enough units available, they must be purchased from another supplier. If any excess items must be purchased, they must be resold. Determine the remaining number of items to be purchased or sold after purchasing from the primary supplier.

 Example itemCount = [10, 20, 30, 40, 15) target = 80 The manager starts buying at index 0 and continues until all available units are purchased or until at least 80 units have been purchased. The manager will buy containers with itemCounts = 10 + 20 + 30 + 40 = 100. Since too many items were purchased, the number sold is purchased - target = 100 - 80 = 20 units. If the target = 130, the manager will purchase all of the units from the primary supplier for a total of purchases = 115. Then another target - purchases = 130 - 115 = 15 additional units must be purchased.

function restock($itemCount, $target)
	 {
	   $tempsum = 0;
	   
	   foreach($itemCount as $val)
	   {
	     if($target > $tempsum)
	     {
	       $tempsum = $tempsum + $val; 
	     }
	   }
	   
	   return abs($target - $tempsum);
	 }
